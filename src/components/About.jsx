                        The business is headed by Andrew and Jane Tye. Andrew was originally a furniture designer. Jane trained as a sculptor.
                        "We have selected pieces which we believe are useful, aesthetically resolved, well made and fair value. We are looking for designs that are innovative, inspiring and that just 'work'.
                        Our goal is to choose carefully the things we live with and to keep them for a long time. We would rather have a few 'good' things. This seems to make sense both economically and ecologically. We hope you agree with this simple principle, and like what we offer."
